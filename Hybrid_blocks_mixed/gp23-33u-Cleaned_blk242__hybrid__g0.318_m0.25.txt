yad-amita-rasa-śāstre vyañji vaidagdhya-vṛndaṃ
tad-aṇum api na vettuṃ kalpate kāmi-lokaḥ ।
tad akhilam api yasya prema-sindhau na kiñcin
mithunam ajita-gopī-rūpam etad vibhāti ।।[] [mālinī]
[] tad evaṃ sati ca sarvāsu tāsu śrī-rādhā punar asādhāraṇatāṃ dhārayati । yathoktaṃ, anayārādhito nūnam ity ādinā । [] tad evam ākalite nirgalite phalitam avakalitaṃ kriyate ।
[] This verse is marked as a quote in Puri Das' edition, but I have no evidence that it is indeed so
